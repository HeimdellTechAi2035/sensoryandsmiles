      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">What are sensory toys and who are they for?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>Sensory toys are specially designed tools that stimulate one or more of a child's senses — touch, sight, sound, smell or proprioception (body awareness). They're beneficial for all children, but especially helpful for kids with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), ADHD, sensory processing disorder (SPD), or anxiety. These toys support self-regulation, focus, and developmental milestones.</p></div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Are your sensory toys safe for toddlers?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>Yes. Every product listing includes a recommended age range. Our toddler-safe toys are free from small parts, non-toxic, BPA-free, and meet <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/toy-safety" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EN 71 &amp; UKCA safety standards</a>. Always supervise young children during play.</p></div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">How do I choose the right sensory toy for my child?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>Consider what type of sensory input your child seeks: <strong>tactile</strong> (texture), <strong>proprioceptive</strong> (deep pressure/weight), <strong>visual</strong> (lights/colours), <strong>auditory</strong> (sounds), or <strong>oral</strong> (chewables). Our product categories and curated kits make it easy to match needs. If you're unsure, <a href="contact.html">contact our support team</a> — we can help recommend toys based on your child's specific needs.</p></div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Do occupational therapists recommend your toys?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>Yes! Many of our products are the same items used in occupational therapy clinics. Our catalogue is reviewed by licensed OTs who specialise in sensory integration, ensuring every toy has genuine therapeutic value — not just marketing hype. Learn more from the <a href="https://www.rcot.co.uk/about-occupational-therapy/what-is-occupational-therapy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Royal College of Occupational Therapists</a>.</p></div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">What ages are your toys suitable for?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>We carry toys for ages 0+ through teens. Each product clearly displays its recommended age range. Our Baby Sensory Starter Kit is designed for 0–12 months, while fidget cubes and weighted plushies are great for school-age children and above.</p></div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">What is your return and refund policy?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>We offer a <strong>30-day no-questions-asked return policy</strong>. If a toy isn't the right fit, simply <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> for a prepaid return label. Refunds are processed within 5–7 business days of receiving the returned item. See our full <a href="shipping-returns.html">Shipping &amp; Returns</a> page for details.</p></div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Do you offer free shipping?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>Yes! Orders over £50 ship free within the United Kingdom. Standard shipping typically takes 3–5 business days. Expedited options are available at checkout for an additional fee.</p></div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Can these toys be used in schools or therapy settings?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>Absolutely. Many teachers, therapists, and special education professionals stock their classrooms and clinics with our toys. We offer <strong>bulk/educator pricing</strong> on larger orders — <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> for details and school purchase order processing.</p></div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Do you ship internationally?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>We currently ship within the United Kingdom. International shipping is coming soon — join our mailing list to be the first to know when we expand to your country.</p></div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Are your packaging materials eco-friendly?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>Yes! All orders ship in recyclable, plastic-free packaging. We use soy-based inks, recycled cardboard, and compostable packing peanuts. We're committed to reducing our environmental impact because caring for kids means caring for their planet.</p></div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">Do you offer gift wrapping?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>Yes! Gift wrapping is available at checkout for a small additional fee. Orders are wrapped in our signature colourful paper with a gift tag. You can also add a personalised message. Our curated kits already come in beautiful gift-ready packaging at no extra charge.</p></div>
      </div>

      <div class="faq-item">
        <button class="faq-question">What payment methods do you accept?</button>
        <div class="faq-answer"><p>All payments are processed securely through <strong><a href="https://www.sumup.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SumUp</a></strong>.
