## Company Overview

Sensory & Smiles is a United Kingdom-based online retailer specialising in therapist-approved sensory toys for children. The company was founded by Andrew James-Smith and Phillip Burton. Andrew's daughter was diagnosed with autism, and his difficulty finding affordable, high-quality sensory toys in the UK inspired the creation of the brand. Every product in the catalogue is reviewed by occupational therapists and meets EN 71 and UKCA toy safety standards. The store accepts GBP payments via SumUp and offers free shipping on UK orders over £50 with a 30-day no-questions-asked return policy.

## Frequently Asked Questions

Q: What are sensory toys and who are they for?
A: Sensory toys are specially designed play items that stimulate one or more of the senses — touch, sight, sound, movement, and proprioception. They are for any child, but particularly beneficial for children with autism spectrum disorder, ADHD, sensory processing disorder, anxiety, or developmental delays.

Q: Are your sensory toys safe for toddlers?
A: Yes. All Sensory & Smiles toys meet EN 71 and UKCA toy safety standards. They are non-toxic, BPA-free, and rigorously tested. Individual product listings include specific age recommendations.

Q: How do I choose the right sensory toy for my child?
A: Consider your child's primary sensory need: deep-pressure calming (weighted toys), focus and stimming (fidget toys), tactile exploration (textured toys), visual calming (light-up toys), or auditory soothing (sound toys). Our gift kits combine multiple categories.

Q: Do occupational therapists recommend your toys?
A: Yes. Our catalogue is reviewed by registered occupational therapists who specialise in sensory integration therapy. We reference the Royal College of Occupational Therapists (RCOT) standards.
